## Writing Guidelines

### Tone
- Professional but accessible
- Constructive, never harsh
- Specific, not vague
- Actionable feedback

### Feedback Examples

**Bad**: "Code quality is poor"
**Good**: "Consider extracting the payment logic in `api/pay.js:45-120` into a separate module for better testability"

**Bad**: "Needs better UX"
**Good**: "Adding loading states during payment processing would improve perceived performance"

### Handling Sensitive Situations

- **Low scores**: Lead with positives, be constructive
- **Timeline issues**: State facts, don't accuse
- **Plagiarism concerns**: Flag for human review, don't conclude

### Localization

Reports should be in the same language as the hackathon (Spanish for X4U2).
Provide both Spanish and English versions when requested.
