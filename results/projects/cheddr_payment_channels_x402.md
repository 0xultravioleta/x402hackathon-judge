## Strengths
- Strong X402 protocol integration
- Feature-complete implementation

## Areas for Improvement
- Code quality could be improved
- Limited innovation beyond basic implementation
- No tests found
- Basic implementation without significant innovation

## Suggestions
- Add linting configuration for consistent code style
- Add tests to improve reliability and maintainability
- Expand README with setup instructions and screenshots

## Project Description
Cheddr Payment Channels for x402 a new payment scheme (v1-eip155-cpc) that replaces per-request on-chain settlement with off-chain EIP‑712 signed receipts.
  Clients open a channel once to lock funds, then pay per API call via signed state updates verified and sequenced to prevent double-spend. Demo includes a paid
  geocoding/reverse-geocoding service plus contracts, sequencer, facilitator, client SDK, and a one-command Docker stack.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
- X402 Usage: MISSING
