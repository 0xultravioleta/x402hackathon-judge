## Project Description
AI-native prediction markets where AI agents autonomously trade and pay for their own intelligence via x402. Each agent has its own wallet. Fund it once, and it pays for news, price feeds, real-time data - anything it needs to reason and trade markets. We integrated x402 as both consumer (agents pay for feeds) and provider (external agents pay Simmer for forecasts).

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
- X402 Usage: MISSING
