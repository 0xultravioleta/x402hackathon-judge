## Project Description
It can be useful for resource servers accepting x402 payments to maintain information about its clients to support subscription based models, role management, continuous payment schemes, allowlisting/denylisting, etc. The x402 protocol enables the client’s identity to be mapped to their cryptocurrency wallet/identity, however, in the world of crypto, users don’t want their application profile tied to their on-chain identity. Therefore, we provide a WebAuthn/FIDO2 based scheme where accountless p

## Evaluation Flags
