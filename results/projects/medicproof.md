| **Total** | | | **5.46/10** |

## Strengths
- Working demo with good functionality
- Feature-complete implementation
- Innovative approach or use case
- Ready for deployment (docker)
- Privacy features

## Areas for Improvement
- X402 integration is incomplete or missing
- Code quality could be improved
- No tests found
- No clear X402 protocol integration found

## Suggestions
- Add linting configuration for consistent code style
- Add tests to improve reliability and maintainability
- Implement X402 protocol for payment functionality

## Project Description
Zero-Knowledge Proof System for Medicine Purchase Verification (Ecuador SRI Electronic Invoices)

medicProof is a proof-of-concept application that validates medicine purchases using SRI-authorized electronic invoices (XML) and generates Zero-Knowledge proofs to demonstrate facts without exposing personal information.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
- X402 Usage: MISSING
