## Project Description
Nexus Protocol is the operating system for Agentic Commerce. It transforms static APIs into a liquid, autonomous labor market where AI agents discover, negotiate, and pay each other in milliseconds using the x402 V2 standard and USDC on Base Sepolia. By implementing EIP-3009 for off-chain authorization and an on-chain Facilitator for gas-less settlement, Nexus creates a frictionless supply chain where "APIs are employees you hire, not tools you rent."

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: EXCELLENT
