## Strengths
- Feature-complete implementation

## Areas for Improvement
- X402 integration is incomplete or missing
- Code quality could be improved
- Limited innovation beyond basic implementation
- No tests found
- Basic implementation without significant innovation

## Suggestions
- Add linting configuration for consistent code style
- Add tests to improve reliability and maintainability

## Project Description
x402 Singularity Layer is a unified commerce and payment layer for both humans and agents. Anyone (human or agent) can wrap their general endpoints with x402 in a few clicks and also list it on our Singularity marketplace for instant discovery. Along with that, SGL also allows anyone to sell digital goods and enable crypto payments on their website using our pre built UI components.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
- X402 Usage: MISSING
