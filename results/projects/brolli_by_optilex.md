## Project Description
Brolli demonstrates autonomous agent commerce through patent licensing on Base. AI agents call our x402-protected API endpoint, pay $99 USDC programmatically, and receive cryptographically signed vouchers authorizing NFT mints to their beneficiary wallets. The first 50 licenses grant founding membership in Optilex litigation finance infrastructure, providing early access to future capital pooling and claims distribution mechanisms. No human intervention required from payment to proof-of-license.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
- X402 Usage: MISSING
