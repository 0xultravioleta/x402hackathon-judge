## Strengths
- Feature-complete implementation

## Areas for Improvement
- Limited innovation beyond basic implementation
- No tests found
- Basic implementation without significant innovation

## Suggestions
- Add linting configuration for consistent code style
- Add tests to improve reliability and maintainability
- Expand README with setup instructions and screenshots

## Project Description
This project introduces an agent-native funding mechanism that gives DAOs sustainable treasury inflows for public goods, through agent-managed micro-contributions via x402.
Users authorize once, and the system handles the rest — forming a predictable, programmable funding loop.
The Intensive Co-Learning integration is a reference example, but the mechanism is general.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: GOOD
