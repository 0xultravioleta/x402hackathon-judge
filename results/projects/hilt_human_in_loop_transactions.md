## Project Description
HILT is a middleware solution for autonomous agent economies (e.g., x402 payment flows). It solves the rogue / hallucinating agent problem by decoupling transaction preparation from transaction execution.
- Preparation: The AI agent navigates paywalls and captures the payment requirements.
- The Loop: The agent is paused and a payment request is pushed to the HILT interface (mobile/web), notifying the user with a human-readable summary.
- Execution: The user signs on their device with the wallet

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: EXCELLENT
