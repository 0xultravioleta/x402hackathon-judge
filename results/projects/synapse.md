## Project Description
Everyone's building AI agents.

Nobody's building agent infrastructure.

→ Where do agents store money?
→ How do they build credit?
→ Who insures their failures?
→ How do they borrow capital?
→ Who settles their disputes?

I spent 2 weeks building all of it.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: EXCELLENT
