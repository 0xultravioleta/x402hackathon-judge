## Project Description
Answer Book is a mystical question ritual powered by x402—a fully client-side guided ceremony where users submit a burning question, pay a small onchain fee, and receive an AI-generated answer from an Agent secured by ERC-8004 identity proofs. It blends tarot-like storytelling with crypto-native payments, letting anyone on Base Sepolia (and soon Base mainnet) "open" their personal book of answers.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
