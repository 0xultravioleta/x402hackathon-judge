## Project Description
x402-guard adds application-layer guardrails to autonomous x402 payments, preventing runaway retries and unsafe follow-up payments by enforcing deterministic policies on payment selection, budgets, and response validity without modifying the x402 protocol.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: BASIC
