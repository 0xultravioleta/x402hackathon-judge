## Project Description
Aegis402 is a Capital-Backed Credit Layer for x402 Agent Payments. Service agents stake, and we compute a credit limit from stake × ERC-8004 reputation. Clients pay agents directly via x402, and if a service agent fails or ghosts, the client is compensated from the agent’s collateral. This turns x402 from “pay and hope they deliver” into “pay and get guaranteed delivery by collateral and credit.”

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: EXCELLENT
