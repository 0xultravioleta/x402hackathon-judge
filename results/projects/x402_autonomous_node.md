- Expand README with setup instructions and screenshots

## Project Description
An autonomous AI agent that negotiates and pays for premium market signals on-chain using the HTTP 402 protocol. It features a "Hybrid Intelligence" engine that cross-references technical analysis (Random Forest) with real-time news sentiment (Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite). The agent autonomously executes USDC payments on Base Sepolia, verifies transactions, and manages a risk-adjusted portfolio via a cyberpunk terminal interface. It demonstrates a fully autonomous machine-to-machine economy whe

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
- X402 Usage: MISSING
