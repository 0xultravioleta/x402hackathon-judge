## Strengths
- Strong X402 protocol integration
- Feature-complete implementation

## Areas for Improvement
- Limited innovation beyond basic implementation
- No tests found
- Basic implementation without significant innovation

## Suggestions
- Add linting configuration for consistent code style
- Add tests to improve reliability and maintainability

## Project Description
Estate Tokens is a decentralized platform that tokenizes real-world properties into fractional ownership shares. Built with Solidity on Base Sepolia, it uses x402 and the PayAI facilitator to enable secure, verified on-chain payments.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: EXCELLENT
