## Project Description
PPS leverages x402 to enable fraction-of-a-cent payments for video streaming. This demo application showcases the concept by letting users share paywalled video links with friends. Each viewer can only watch after making a tiny, per-view (or per-time) payment.

Compared to traditional pay-per-view systems, PPS is a major upgrade: no subscriptions, no clunky checkout flows, no minimum $1/$5 payment rails, and no high platform fees.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
- X402 Usage: MISSING
