## Project Description
'- Problem
Blockchain analytics are powerful but difficult to monetize flexibly. Most data APIs rely on subscriptions or static API keys, which makes them inefficient for AI agents, scripts, and on-demand workflows that only need small amounts of data per request.

- Solution
This project is a testnet-deployed pay-per-request API that exposes Bitquery’s real-time blockchain analytics using the x402 payment protocol. Instead of subscriptions, users make USDC micropayments per request to access en

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: EXCELLENT
