## Project Description
Credpay is a zero-interest crypto credit layer that lets users access real-world spending without liquidating their assets. This hackathon project shows how Credpay can be composed with x402 to allow apps and agents to continue execution after a 402 Payment Required, by providing on-demand credit instead of requiring upfront liquidity.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: BASIC
