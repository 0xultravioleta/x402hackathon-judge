## Project Description
A machine-to-machine marketplace infrastructure designed to democratize access to high-value data. Acting as a middleware, the "Broker Agent" fractionalizes expensive API feeds and resells them to smaller consumer agents via micro-transactions. The system utilizes the HTTP 402 protocol and Coinbase AgentKit for autonomous negotiation, cryptographic identity verification, and payment handling.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
- X402 Usage: MISSING
