## Project Description
Grantees is a grant intelligence and capital access API built for builders. It analyzes real GitHub activity to help founders understand which grants they qualify for, why they’re a fit, and where to focus next. Powered by x402, Grantees uses a pay-per-analysis model no subscriptions, no gatekeepers making grant access more transparent and accessible, especially for builders in emerging markets and the Global South.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
