## Strengths
- Strong X402 protocol integration
- Feature-complete implementation

## Areas for Improvement
- Demo functionality needs improvement
- Code quality could be improved
- Limited innovation beyond basic implementation
- README needs more detail
- No tests found

## Suggestions
- Add linting configuration for consistent code style
- Add tests to improve reliability and maintainability
- Expand README with setup instructions and screenshots

## Project Description
Verifiable Green Compute Network is a protocol router for AI content generation on green distributed compute. Users pay via x402; The protocol routes each request to the best provider (Lektra nodes or OpenAI) and generates a verifiable execution receipt (Chainlink CRE). Smart contracts settle transparent on-chain payouts to providers.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
- X402 Usage: MISSING
