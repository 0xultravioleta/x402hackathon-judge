## Project Description
Voice-activated crypto payments for Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses on Unichain. VoiceSwap enables hands-free USDC payments via voice commands, QR code scanning, and x402-powered swap execution. Users can simply say "Pay $25 to CoffeeShop" through their smart glasses and execute instant DeFi transactions. The backend provides Swap-as-a-Service APIs where AI agents pay micropayments via x402 protocol to get quotes, routes, and execute Uniswap V4 swaps on Unichain no API keys needed.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
- X402 Usage: MISSING
