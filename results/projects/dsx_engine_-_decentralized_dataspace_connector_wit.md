## Project Description
DSX Engine is a truly decentralized dataspace connector built on top of Eclipse Dataspace Components, designed to enable secure, sovereign, and interoperable data exchange without relying on central intermediaries.

What sets DSX Engine apart is its native integration of the x402 Payment Protocol, which brings real data-economy capabilities directly into the dataspace. With x402, data access can be monetized at the protocol level using cryptographic, verifiable, and automated payments—enabling p

## Evaluation Flags
