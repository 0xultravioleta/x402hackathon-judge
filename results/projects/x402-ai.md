## Project Description
x402-AI is a Solana-native micropayment gateway for multi-LLM inference that uses the x402 “HTTP 402 payflow” to enforce pay-per-request AI usage. Users or autonomous agents pay a small amount of USDC/SOL per LLM call, the gateway verifies the on-chain transfer, and records an Anchor PaymentRecord for auditability. This enables trustless, usage-based monetization and metering of AI on Solana.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
- X402 Usage: MISSING
