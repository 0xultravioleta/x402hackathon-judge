## Project Description
The Weather x402 API - pay-per-use weather data with USDC micropayments on Base mainnet.
Request weather data, get a 402 Payment Required response with the exact amount. Connect MetaMask, pay in USDC, and receive your data. All payments are verified on-chain before serving.You can also use our built in agent to fetch data (The agent will pay for the service)
Our Cascade Endpoints fetch all three weather endpoints at once, plus generate a true random number from weather data entropy - using real-

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: EXCELLENT
