## Project Description
Decentralized identity has advanced rapidly, with Verifiable Credentials commonly issued over standardized protocols like OpenID Connect (OIDC). However, how users and AI agents pay for credentials remains largely unexplored, despite issuers needing sustainable business models.

This project combines x402 micropayments with OIDC-based credential issuance to enable a simple pay-per-credential flow. Users and AI agents can obtain Verifiable Credentials such as credit scores, financial reputation, 

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: EXCELLENT
