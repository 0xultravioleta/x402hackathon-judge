| Innovation | 4.0/10 | 10% | 0.40 |
| **Total** | | | **4.82/10** |

## Strengths
- High code quality with good practices
- Feature-complete implementation

## Areas for Improvement
- X402 integration is incomplete or missing
- Limited innovation beyond basic implementation
- Basic implementation without significant innovation
- No clear X402 protocol integration found

## Suggestions
- Add linting configuration for consistent code style
- Implement X402 protocol for payment functionality

## Project Description
AgentARC is an free and open-source security layer for AI agents that transact on-chain. It validates every transaction through intent analysis, deterministic policies, transaction simulation, honeypot detection, and optional LLM-based threat analysis, blocking unsafe execution before funds are signed or broadcast. Designed as a drop-in wrapper for Coinbase AgentKit agents.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
- X402 Usage: MISSING
