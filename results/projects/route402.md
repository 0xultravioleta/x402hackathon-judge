- Add tests to improve reliability and maintainability

## Project Description
Multi‑tenant x402 facilitator router/proxy that presents a facilitator‑compatible API (/verify, /settle, /supported) and picks the best provider per request using a YAML ruleset. It supports capability‑aware routing, latency and error rate aware routing, encrypted credentials, RBAC‑gated admin actions, and sticky/idempotent settlement.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: BASIC
