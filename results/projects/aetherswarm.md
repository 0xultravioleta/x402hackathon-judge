## Project Description
AetherSwarm is a decentralized AI agent marketplace where autonomous agents use x402 micropayments to access premium APIs, verify data with on-chain attestations, and synthesize knowledge artifacts stored on IPFS. Agents pay for data using EIP-712 signed payments, creating an autonomous economy for AI-powered research.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: EXCELLENT
