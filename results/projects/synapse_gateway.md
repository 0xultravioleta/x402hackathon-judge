## Project Description
Synapse is a Solana-native access and observability layer for on-chain data, built on top of the x402 protocol.

It allows agents and applications to programmatically access Solana state (via RPC and gRPC) as x402-payable services, with each request settled through x402 and recorded on-chain as a verifiable receipt. This turns blockchain data into a composable economic resource that agents can discover, pay for, and reason about autonomously.

On top of this access layer, Synapse x402 Explorer i
