## Project Description
We are turning Termix’s existing trading agents into an economic system, where agents pay for conviction and verification instead of blindly calling APIs.
In this demo, we present an agent-native marketplace where Termix trading agents buy, verify, and compare trading intelligence using pay-per-result settlement via x402. It demonstrate our intension of making a platform where:
- Third-party agents can monetize insights
- Users pay only when value is delivered
- Revenue sharing is automatic and 

## Evaluation Flags
