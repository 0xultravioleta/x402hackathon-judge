## Project Description
ORA402 - Provably Fair On-Chain Lottery:

Frontend: 
-- User picks a number (1-402) in the UI -> API responds with X402 payment request -> UI wraps SOL to wSOL and pays 0.003 SOL to backend

Backend orchestrates on-chain:
-- submit_guess -> deposit_to_pool -> request_randomness (Orao VRF) -> reveal_result -> close_game (loss) or payout (win)

Result streams back to UI via SSE. 

All randomness is verifiable on-chain -- no trust required.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: CRITICAL (100.0% pre-existing commits)
- X402 Usage: EXCELLENT
