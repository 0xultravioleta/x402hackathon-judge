## Project Description
PredictOS is an open-source AI-powered operating system that bridges the worlds of prediction markets, artificial intelligence, and agentic payments. At its core, PredictOS enables builders to deploy custom multi-agent AI systems that analyze and trade on platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi—but what makes it truly revolutionary is its native integration with x402 and PayAI. Through the HTTP 402 payment protocol, PredictOS agents can autonomously discover and pay for premium AI services, alterna
