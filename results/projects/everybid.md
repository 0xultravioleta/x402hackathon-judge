## Project Description
Everybid is an experimental framework that enhances Uniswap's Continuous Clearing Auction (CCA) with demand-responsive supply adjustments. By monitoring live auction metrics and safely adjusting future token issuance, Everybid helps auctions achieve better price discovery and fairer distributions
Everybid uses x402 micropayments as the Web2-friendly gate to experimental auction optimizations. While our main focus is exploring dynamic supply scheduling for CCA auctions, x402 provides the essentia

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: PASS
- X402 Usage: MISSING
