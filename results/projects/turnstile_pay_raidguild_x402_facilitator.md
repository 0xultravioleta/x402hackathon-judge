## Project Description
Turnstile Pay is the missing payment layer for the agent economy. It's a hosted x402 facilitator that handles wallet and signature complexity so AI agents can pay instantly. Features include instant on-chain settlement, non-custodial architecture, drop-in API integration, and gasless payments via EIP-3009—all on Base L2 with USDC. Developers can use our hosted dashboard or self-host the open-source Go facilitator. API keys cost 0.1 USDC for 30 days. Humans have Stripe; agents now have Turnstile 

## Evaluation Flags
