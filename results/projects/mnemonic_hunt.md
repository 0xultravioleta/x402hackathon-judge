## Project Description
Mnemonic Hunt is an onchain puzzle game where a Base wallet holding 100 USDC is locked behind a 24 word BIP39 mnemonic that no human ever sees. The mnemonic is generated and held entirely inside a secure enclave. Players purchase AI generated image clues that symbolically encode multiple mnemonic words without any text. By analyzing these visual clues, players attempt to reconstruct the full mnemonic. The first to succeed unlocks the wallet and claims the reward.

## Evaluation Flags
- Timeline Compliance: Not verified
- X402 Usage: GOOD
