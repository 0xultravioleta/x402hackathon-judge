Deep integration of the x402 protocol for an ""instant payout"" experience: We have deeply integrated the x402 protocol into the betting process. User betting is no longer a traditional on-chain transaction, but is completed by calling our payment interface integrated with the x402 standard. This enables low-fee, high-frequency betting, perfectly matching user behavior in gambling scenarios, representing an innovative application of x402 in the ""high-frequency micro-payment"" field for end users.

Building a verifiable AI gaming arena: The platform deploys multiple AI players with different strategies (such as tight-aggressive, loose-aggressive, GTO models, etc.). All AI's game logic and decision-making processes run on-chain or in a verifiable environment, ensuring absolute fairness and immutability of the competition. The essence of user betting is prediction based on understanding the AI's strategy, creating a completely new ""spectator-style"" gambling experience.

Innovative ""Winner-Shared Prize Pool"" Mechanism: Unlike the traditional ""sole win"" model of gambling, we adopt a ""supporter-shared"" model. All users who bet on the champion AI will form a ""supporter camp"" and share the total prize pool for the competition. This reduces individual risk, enhances community participation and collective honor, and encourages users to delve into AI strategies rather than relying solely on luck.

Providing an Entertainment Sandbox for the ""Agent Economy"": This project is essentially a demonstration sandbox for a multi-agent competitive ecosystem running on the blockchain. The x402 protocol serves as the infrastructure for the flow of value among agents. This is not just a gaming platform, but also provides an intuitive and interactive demonstration case for the more complex ""AI agent economy"" of the future, showcasing the complete closed loop where agents generate value by providing services (in this case, entertainment competitions) and users distribute that value through micropayments.

Clear Technical Implementation Path:

Frontend: Uses React/Next.js to provide a smooth viewing and betting interface.

Smart Contracts: Responsible for managing the prize pool, recording bets, verifying competition results, and executing automatic profit distribution. AI Gaming Engine: Runs Texas Hold'em AI games on dedicated servers or verifiable environments, submitting the final score results to on-chain arbitration.

x402 Payment Integration: Acts as a key payment layer, processing all instant, small-amount payment requests from users' bets.

We believe this project is not only a cool application of the x402 protocol, but also a proactive exploration of the future landscape of decentralized AI entertainment and prediction markets.",checked,12/18/2025,"x402 Protocol Core Stack: Developed according to the x402 open protocol standard.

NodusAI operates as a secure, three-layer data pipeline designed for verifiable signal extraction. Our stack transforms raw, unstructured market data into structured, actionable intelligence. We combine the power of advanced language models with live web validation and a native, session-based payment layer.

The Gemini Oracle Agent
The Oracle is a fine-tuned, large language model (LLM) optimized for rapid probability assessment and structured JSON output. It functions as the central reasoning engine, translating complex market questions into a clear, analytical format suitable for high-stakes decision-making. We leverage the Gemini 2.5 Flash model for its optimal balance of speed, cost efficiency, and powerful reasoning.

Data Grounding
Grounding is a non-negotiable step that tethers every Oracle output to verifiable, real-time web sources. This process minimizes factual errors (hallucinations) by injecting fresh data into the model's reasoning loop. Before delivering a signal, the Oracle performs multiple real-time search queries to confirm or deny facts related to the market question.

NodusAI implements the x402 payment protocol, a modern interpretation of the HTTP 402 status code. This enables native, per-request micropayments using USDC on the Base network. No subscriptions, no API keys to manage just connect your wallet and pay per query."

BiTx402,"'- Problem
Blockchain analytics are powerful but difficult to monetize flexibly. Most data APIs rely on subscriptions or static API keys, which makes them inefficient for AI agents, scripts, and on-demand workflows that only need small amounts of data per request.

- Solution
This project is a testnet-deployed pay-per-request API that exposes Bitquery’s real-time blockchain analytics using the x402 payment protocol. Instead of subscriptions, users make USDC micropayments per request to access endpoints such as:
Latest token price
OHLC data
Average price
Trade volume
The API demonstrates a flexible monetization model for blockchain data and includes a simple HTML client that showcases the full x402 flow (request → 402 response → payment → data).

- Why x402 + Bitquery
Bitquery provides the data. x402 provides the monetization layer. Together, they unlock a new access model for blockchain analytics.
Bitquery offers high-quality, real-time, cross-chain analytics that are valuable at a per-query level.
x402 enables protocol-native, trustless micropayments without accounts, subscriptions, or API keys.
Combined, they allow developers and AI agents to pay only for the exact data they need, making blockchain analytics more composable and programmable.
This project shows how Bitquery can act as a first-class data provider in the x402 ecosystem, enabling new economic models for on-chain data access.",https://github.com/Kshitij0O7/bitquery-x402/tree/main,,https://x.com/kshitij007527/status/2004453652245963115,@ks_mahajan,Kshitij.mahajan@bitquery.io,"GitHub - https://github.com/Kshitij0O7

OIDCx402 - Micropayments for decentralized identity,"Decentralized identity has advanced rapidly, with Verifiable Credentials commonly issued over standardized protocols like OpenID Connect (OIDC).

This project combines x402 micropayments with OIDC-based credential issuance to enable a simple pay-per-credential flow. Users and AI agents can obtain Verifiable Credentials such as credit scores, financial reputation, or KYC and government ID attestations. For example, a credit score credential can be derived from on-chain activity and reused across multiple platforms.

These credentials can also be used on-chain via zero-knowledge proofs, where smart contracts verify only proofs and not raw data. Using frameworks like zkID from Ethereum PSE, users and AI agents can prove properties of credentials privately, unlocking new identity-aware DeFi and on-chain use cases.",https://github.com/lutralabs/x402-hackathon,"https://x402-demo.lutralabs.io - live demo

Each dataspace participant remains in full control to decide how automated or how manual their data exchange and payment flows should be.

We’ve built a seamless way to transfer payment ownership to agents with just a single line of code.

To support the hackathon participants and boost ecosystem growth, we are currently offering $5 in free credits to all early users. This covers over 1,000 requests for models like Gemini 3 Flash, allowing developers to build and test their autonomous agents without any upfront costs.
I would love to connect with your foundation's marketing team to discuss potential collaborations, such as:
Hackathon Marketing: Promoting Halo’s $5 credit offer to participants as a resource for their projects.
Automated Token Holder Benefits: We have the technical capability to automatically distribute or increase credits for specific token holders within your ecosystem, creating direct utility and incentive for your community.
Halo is designed to be a ""drop-in"" solution—developers just need to swap their Base URL and API Key to start. We believe this could be a high-impact addition to your upcoming marketing initiatives.
Are you available for a brief chat to explore how we can integrate these incentives into your ecosystem?

It allows agents and applications to programmatically access Solana state (via RPC and gRPC) as x402-payable services, with each request settled through x402 and recorded on-chain as a verifiable receipt. This turns blockchain data into a composable economic resource that agents can discover, pay for, and reason about autonomously.

On top of this access layer, Synapse x402 Explorer indexes all x402 activity on Solana across merchants, facilitators, and agents, and exposes the economic and operational state of the network in real time — including service usage, flows, volumes, and reliability signals.

Together, this creates an agent-native data economy on Solana where agents can:
- Discover available services,
-Pay per use without accounts or subscriptions,
- Verify execution via on-chain receipts, and observe the network they operate in.

Synapse bridges on-chain payments and off-chain execution into a unified system designed for autonomous agents and programmatic infrastructure.",https://github.com/OOBE-PROTOCOL/x402-synapse-rpc-server,,https://x.com/SteveTheHead_/status/2008159798613692549," @ethercode_0xKpt, https://t.me/oobesol","keepeetofficial@gmail.com, support@oobeprotocol.ai","'@SteveTheHead_ , @OOBEonSol (X accounts)",,checked,1/5/2026,"""dependencies"": {

All agents and workflows are executable directly on the platform, and creators get rewarded per-use.
There are also some interesting DeFi features like cloning (a native 'compose' agent) or warping (an external agent) agents to add details/expand capabilities.

Manowar is a new ‘atomic’ standard where:
- workflows are ‘nested’ ERC7401 made of composable agents
- agents are ERC8004 with unique addresses and unique features:
    - Agents can discover and talk to each other (A2A+ACP standard manifest)

        - 50k+ models (2100 in app/playground, the _extended models registry endpoint is in the docs)
        - 32k+ MCP tools

All models' endpoints follow an OpenAI-compatible standard - and we've built an abstraction layer to parse inputs and responses in provider-agnostic way - so that you don't have to.

Autostack DCA,"AutoStack DCA is a non-custodial dollar cost averaging platform on Base Mainnet that revolutionizes how retail traders execute DCA strategies. Unlike traditional DCA tools that require depositing funds into vaults or trusting centralized services, AutoStack keeps your tokens in your wallet until the exact moment of each swap - eliminating custody risk entirely.

The platform's standout feature is Smart Money DCA: instead of blindly executing at fixed intervals, AutoStack monitors Nansen-labeled wallets (VCs, hedge funds, and proven smart money addresses) and automatically triggers your DCA when these whales make qualifying purchases. You configure the parameters - minimum trade size ($1K to $1M), wallet reputation score (0-100), signal accumulation thresholds, and time windows - giving you institutional-grade entry timing without the research overhead.

 Under the hood, AutoStack combines four cutting-edge technologies:

  1. ERC-7715 Permissions - Users grant time-bounded, amount-limited spending permissions to the smart contract. No infinite approvals, fully revocable anytime.

  2. Envio HyperIndex - Real-time blockchain indexing delivers instant dashboard updates. When a strategy is created or a swap executes, users see it within milliseconds.

  3. x402 Protocol - Whale data from Nansen's API is accessed via HTTP-native micropayments (~$0.01 USDC per request on Solana). No API keys, no subscriptions, no middlemen.

  4. Uniswap V3 Integration - Production swaps execute through SwapRouter02 on Base Mainnet with configurable pool fee tiers (0.05%, 0.3%, 1%) for optimal execution.

The platform supports four strategy types: Basic DCA (traditional time-based), Smart Money DCA (whale-triggered), Signal Accumulation (waits for multiple whale signals within a window), and Hybrid (combines time-based with smart money triggers). This flexibility lets users match their risk tolerance and market thesis.
